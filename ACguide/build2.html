    <div id="top-content">
        <img src="ACimages\heavy-build.webp" alt="image of heavy build">
        <p>Pros:

        <br>- High armor points: Heavy builds can take a lot of hits without dying.

        <br>- Strong stance: Heavy builds don't stagger easily, meaning they can attack for long periods of time without being interrupted.

        <br>- High weight limit: Much more powerful units become available with heavy builds. 
        <br>
        <br>Cons:

        <br>- Poor evasive maneuverability: You will likely trade more hits 

        <br>- Low boost speed: Poor chase capabilities 

        <br>- Higher energy consumption: Heavier parts naturally consume more energy.
