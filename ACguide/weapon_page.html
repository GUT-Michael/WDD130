      <p>Be sure to balance energy type weapons(pulse, laser, coral, etc) with kinetic or explosive weapons. Weapons draw from the same power source as your AC and can overdraw the generator's energy capacity. Larger weapons will also naturally put a larger weight burden on the AC. Carrying capacity is dependent on the AC's equipped arms and legs. </p>

      Long range weapons are designed for engagements beyond 260 meters. These weapons generally have high damage and low fire rates, with the exception of some late game units, but also afford safer positioning for ACs. To open shop availability, be sure to complete all AC training modules and replay past missions to acquire battle logs.

      Mid range weapons are generally most effective in the 130 - 260 meter range. ACs have access early game to a wide range of rapid fire and high impact weapon types that each build strain in their own way, making these units optimal for early game use. Most FCS (processors) scale well with mid range units. To open shop availability, be sure to complete all AC training modules and replay past missions to acquire battle logs.

    <p>
      Close range weapons generally are most effective when in at least 130 meter proximity to their targets. Their high impact and damage potential make up for their usually low fire rate. It is best to use these units with an AC that can utilize either high mobility to approach their target or has high impact tolerance. To open shop availability, be sure to complete all AC training modules and replay past missions to acquire battle logs.
